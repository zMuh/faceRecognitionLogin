# Face Recognition Login System

This project demonstrates a smart login system that uses facial recognition to control an LED. When an authorized face is detected, the LED turns on. 

## How It Works

1. **Idle State**: While the system is not detecting any authorized face, the LED stays off.

2. **Face Detection**: When the system detects an authorized face, the LED turns on.
